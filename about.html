                    <h1 class="title">Whole Sale and Bulk Order Supplier in Pakistan.</h1>
                    <p>We are a leading manufacturer and bulk order supplier of Salt Crystal Products. Our factory is located near Lahore, Pakistan. We have been manufacturing salt lamps for over a decade. Manufacturing and wholesale of Himalayan Salt products
                        is our only business, and we can proudly say that we are the best.
                        <p> We are blessed with the best talent Pakistan has to offer. Our craftsmen have been with us since day one. They are paid the best salaries, in their respective fields. Overtime is paid when necessary and medical expenses are paid
                            for all. </p>
                        <p> We have adopted a number of quality assurance steps to provide our customers with the best products, which are delivered in a timely manner. A performance point system is also in place to assure the quality of our products. </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the cornerstones of our company policy is to never hire any under-age employees to cut corners in order to save in production costs. We wholeheartedly believe the best place for our children is in schools. We truly hope that others will follow
                            our example and stop hiring under-age employees, so kids can enjoy being just kids. </p>
                        <p> Our highly skilled labor force craft these products from natural rock salt also known as Himalayan salt, mined from salt beds created from seas which dried out over 250 million years ago. some Geologists put the age of rock-salt
                            found in Khewra at about 600 million years. In geological timescale this time period is called Precambrian. This highest quality natural salt is explored from mountenous earth at the foothills of the Salt Range located at Khewra
                            Salt Mines, Tehsil Pind Dadan Khan, Jhelum District. 200km from Islamabad. Lahore-Islamabad Motorway, Lilla exit. (32°38’47.53″N, 73° 0’25.05″E). Khewra salt mines are the largest mines in the Asia & second largest salt mines
                            in the world. </p>
                        <p> In 326 BC these resources were discovered by the troops of Alexander the Great, who noted the licking of the stones by their horses. </p>
                        <p> The salt is normally white,pink & red which contains up to 84 minerals. the Himalayan rock salt is the best salt in the world and an excellent source of negative ions we have so far crafted more than 5000 different designs and
                            styles of salt products and exported our products to more than 50 countries.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mytab" id="tab1">
                    <p>The salt crystal lamps have a similar effect to the ionizer. However, the natural ionization of a crystal lamp cannot be compared to an ionizer. A salt crystal lamp can only have an ionization effect. However, salt crystal lamps have
                        many advantages in many aspects and improve the general atmosphere of a room.</p>
                    <p>If the lamp is next to a television or computer monitor, its effect, through its electromagnetic field, of the device is in approximately the 100-160 Hz zone. Our brain waves however, produce only 8 Hz according to the Schuman resonance
                        frequency. Therefore, the body is exposed to up to 20 times higher frequency patterns than it is generally used to. The consequences of this exposure results in nervousness, insomnia and lack of concentration or concentration weaknesses.
                        In addition, there will be an accumulation of more free radicals in the body, known to be a cause of cancer.</p>
                    <p>The salt crystal lamp binds the negative ions with the excess positive ions. When the lamp becomes warm, it absorbs moisture and the crystal will be damp on the surface. This builds up the ion field. Through the lamp, the positively
                        charged atmosphere of a room can be neutralized.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this, the colors of the salt crystal stones have a healing effect. The therapeutic value of the colored crystals can reorganize the epidermal layer of our skin. Tests made with kids having ADHD symptoms have shown that
                        after only one week of exposure to crystal salt lamps, their symptoms subsided. After removing the lamps, the symptoms returned.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Research results:</h1>
                    <p>It’s a well know fact that, through scientific and empirical research, salt crystal lamps exhibit biophysical characteristics, which demonstrate a positive effect on our well-being. From a scientific view there are three natural action
                        principles at play: ionization, the electromagnetic oscillation and the transparent-crystalline structure developing the light waves.</p>
                    <p>Before we discuss the above mentioned characteristics of the salt crystal lamps in detail, we would like to point out that salt is a primal element, like water and air and its natural minerals and trace element have unique biophysical
                        and biochemical characteristics. Salt is to be regarded as neutral, chemically as well as physically, without its own polarity, always balancing and neutralizing. Exactly like our planet earth’s makeup, human beings consist of
                        about 70% water; brine water more specifically. This enormous potential on enclosed brine solution transmits the cosmic oscillation (vibration) energy, not only evenly over our planets, but also reaches deep into our most minute
                        cells and nerves. It is not only the salt from a chemical view that the body needs in order to maintain our entire bodily functions, but the salt, from biophysical view, will always be able to bring the body back into its natural
                        energy vibration rhythm.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Salt Crystal Lamps and Ionization:</h1>
                    <p>Worldwide laboratory tests with the most diverse kinds of measuring methodology furnished the proof that lighted salt crystal lamps deliver ions to our environment. Primarily, the research points to an increased number of negative
                        ions. The emission of ions is primarily caused by the alternating actions of the salt’s ability to first absorb water, and then evaporate it. To explain this more precisely, the heated salt crystal attracts the water molecules
                        from the ambient air to its surface. The salt goes into a solution as it mixes with the water molecules. Sodium, as the positively charged ion, and chloride, as a negatively charged ion, becomes neutral and are emitted back into
                        the environment. The uniqueness of this ion emission interrelation is only possible with the mineral salt, since salt possesses this transformation ability with water due to its electrically neutral atomic structure.</p>
                    <p>Scientific investigations of the last decades proved clearly that a balanced ion relationship with a little surplus of negative ions could have extremely positive affects on our entire physical condition and our health. The heated
                        salt crystal lamps can be referred to, according to research, as natural ion generators. Here however it is pointed out that the emission of ions by heated salt crystal lamps, should not be regarded as the primary characteristic,
                        because from scientific standpoint, the surplus of negative ions is negligible. More important is its ability to clean the ambient air. Depending upon size and surface area of the salt crystal used for the lamp, the ambient air
                        surrounding it is measurably cleaned by the transformation cycle of hydrogen and oxygen, as well as sodium and chloride ions. This characteristic is especially helpful for relieving the symptoms associated with asthma and allergies
                        in general.</p>
                    <p>The research of the characteristics of pure, or cleaned air through the action of the salt crystal lamps, is based on a medical therapy called Spelaeotherapy, a treatment where the patient enters an underground salt mine and is exposed
                        to the concentrated atmosphere of negative ions. Further scientific research has not taken place yet under medical guidance, since scientific investigations are still at the beginning stages. One cannot compare the therapeutic
                        effect of a singular salt crystal lamp to the effects found in a salt cave (mine), when conducted according to medical guidelines. However, there have been a great variety of holistic and positive self-therapy results, which can
                        be classified as scientifically subjective, and should be recognized and considered.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Salt Crystal Lamps and Electromagnetic Oscillation:</h1>
                    <p>An electromagnetic belt surrounds the Earth, and within this belt every form of life comes and goes. Therefore, every form of life on this planet earth depends on the power of this electromagnetic field of vibration, known as the Schuman
                        resonance frequency, which states that the given frequency of this electromagnetic field is at 7.83 Hz (cycles) per second. This value in known to be the resonant frequency of our earth. The resonant frequency is the most often
                        frequency of measurement applied to mammals and can be measured as the resonant frequency of our brains with an EEG.</p>
                    <p>Also, a salt crystal, in its neutral state, exhibits this exact frequency oscillation value. But due to our industrialized and technical way of life, the human organism is being affected, particularly in our homes and offices, to artificial
                        electromagnetic wavelengths with the most diverse frequency values, caused by electronics devices. These frequencies have been proven not only to disturb our human organism, but also to promote illness, since they constantly overlap
                        our natural resonant frequency. As a result of this constant exposure to various frequencies, our own electromagnetic energy field becomes imprinted by the frequencies forced upon it, which upsets the natural development of our
                        cells. Because of the atomic structure of the salt, which is already neutral, it is most likely that the artificial frequencies can be harmonized or balanced by the lit salt lamp as it works as a natural amplifier for the resonant
                        frequency of 8-10 cycles per second, which is so necessary for our life. With the use of a salt crystal lamp we can adjust and neutralize electromagnetic wavelengths caused by electronic devices in natural way.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Salt Crystal Lamps and Light Waves:</h1>
                    <p>When we talk about light we mean, for the most part, the oscillation energies, or electromagnetic wavelengths, which lie in a nanometer, range visible to our human eye. From the color therapy it is well-known that the human organism
                        needs the light waves of the rainbow spectrum (300-700 nanometers) for the health and preservation of the body. Our body’s cells are supplied by light with new energy in the form of electromagnetic wavelengths. Thus the atomic
                        structure of each individual cell vibrates in its own given order and can radiate bio photons as the cell’s own electromagnetic energy field.</p>
                    <p>The specific oscillation values of salt crystal lamps depend upon crystalline color structure in the so-called warm clay/tone range of 600-700 nanometers. For decades, the field of medicine has been using irradiation with monochromatic
                        light, since these color vibration areas exert direct influence on our cell producing functions. To what extent a salt crystal lamp can be employed for natural irradiation therapy, is yet to be seen without further research. However,
                        salt crystal lamps have been used therapeutically for years.</p>

                    <h1 class="title">Salt Crystals for Brine Solution</h1>
                    <p>Today people all across Europe, and now in North America are discovering the unlimited benefits of Himalayan Salt. Brine solution or Salt water (Namkeen Pani) as the populace will say, has been used for centuries.</p>
                    <p>The Gama International supplies for the body with the natural energy stored in the crystals and the body can hold this for up to 24 hours. It provides the body with essential minerals and replenishes vital electrolytes. The salt can
                        harmonize the alkaline/acidity balance in the body and normalize blood pressure. It can even help with skin diseases such as acne and eczema by cleaning from the inside out.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">How to prepare Brine Solution</h1>
                    <p>Put several Himalayan Salt crystals in a glass jar (preferably one that can be closed and opened easily) Fill 3/4 of the jar with distilled or spring water. After several hours you will obtain a brine solution with a salt part of approximately
                        26%. The salt crystals will stop dissolving further and the concentration will remain the same as long as there are Himalayan Salt crystals in the water. The brine solution can be topped up with water until all crystals have dissolved
                        completely. This brine solution is absolutely sterile and germ-free. It can therefore be stored for years in a closed glass container without changing or decomposing.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">For drinking therapy</h1>
                    <p>Take one teaspoon of Brine solution once a day in the morning (30 minutes before breakfast) in a glass of fresh spring water. During the day drink at least 6-8 glasses of pure spring water.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mytab" id="tab3">
                    <p>Salt has hygroscopic properties, which means that it draws water from the surrounding atmosphere. Salt Crystal Lamps should therefore never be sprinkled with water, kept in a moist room or be placed outdoors. Sometimes, in particularly
                        moist or humid conditions, the lamp surface may be slightly damp to the touch. Lighting it for a few hours dries it very quickly.</p>
                    <p>If crystallization occurs, just wiping with a damp cloth will get rid of it. For most everyday situations, this is not a concern. It is recommended that you light your lamp every day for the best air purifying results, and you can
                        leave your lamps on for as long as possible. This will not only maintain a constant negative ionizing process, but also repel excess moisture build up around the lamp.</p>
                    <p>If you plan not to use the lamp for long periods of time, just put a plastic bag over the lamp to protect it from humidity.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">How to clean your salt lamp</h1>
                    <p>Wipe the lamp with a damp (not soaking wet) towel or sponge in order to remove dust. Once cleaned, dry the lamp with a paper towel or turn on the lamp for a while.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Warning: Keep out of reach of children.</h1>
                    <p>Always unplug the lamp before changing the light bulb to prevent electric shock. If you choose to place a Salt Crystal Lamp on a wooden surface, please ensure that it has a waterproof base so that you do not damage your furniture.</p>

                    <h1 class="heading">Speleotherapy with Salt Lamps.</h1>
                    <p>Speleotherapy means to be located in a room or area with a presence of Salt Crystal Rock and to breathe the Ionized air. Speleotherapy is a therapeutic measure in the treatment of chronic obstructive airways diseases and as an alternative
                        treatment for asthma.</p>
                    <p>It is used extensively in Eastern Europe; including Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Armenia, as well as in Asian countries; specially South Korea as a natural health alternative for respiratory conditions, immune system dysfunction
                        and illnesses. Although rarely practiced in the U.S. and Canada, many therapists, upscale health spas and clinics around the country increasingly recognize the benefits of Speleotherapy.</p>
                    <img src="https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2017/12/03222711/wide-salt-cave.jpg">
                    <p>Speleotherapy, a process that involves using the health enhancing effect of salt mines or caves to ease asthma, is an old and yet popular alternative therapy.</p>
                    <p>The positive impact of the cave environment in general and salt’s particular effect on man’s health has been known since ancient times. Early on, people noticed that wounded animals escaped to caves, where they healed their wounds
                        or stings. People investigated this phenomena and a new branch of medicine called Speleotherapy began. (“speleo” is Greek for cave). One study describes a course of therapy that was 4 hours a day for 6-8 weeks; the 100 asthma patients
                        reported improvement, which lasted 6 months to 7 years (Skulimowski, 1965).</p>
                    <p>During the wars in the 1940’s, many villagers hid from their enemies in salt laden caves and mines for weeks. They discovered that coughs, stuffy noses, and other breathing ailments were alleviated.</p>

                    <p>Researchers from the former Soviet Union have noted that more than 5,000 scientific documents support the concept that high doses of negative ions have positive effects, while the opposite is true with exposure to high doses of positive
                        ions. They were among the first to become convinced of the benefits of negative ion treatment for individuals with various illnesses, especially asthma, bronchitis and upper respiratory problems.</p>
                    <p>Ion therapy has also been used extensively in the Middle East – especially Israel, Europe and the Orient. In the U.S. holistic health practitioners have used it primarily, although ion therapy did enjoy some popularity in the 1960s
                        for the treatment of burn patients. Its greatest use has been in the treatment of the roughly 25% of the population that is “weather sensitive,” who without treatment can be very nearly incapacitated when pollutant, and particularly
                        positive ion, levels rise. The Soviets published numerous reports indicating that even brief periods of negative ion exposure (15 minutes a day for 25 days for example) resulted in improved responses to training in runners, boxers,
                        swimmers and other athletes. These responses included greater rates of gains, in both strength and endurance, as well as in improved psychological characteristics, sleep habits and appetite. The greater the level of physical stress,
                        such as from training overload, the greater the effect the ion treatments seemed to have. This finding agrees with the beliefs of the leading ion researchers worldwide that those who benefit the most include the very young, the
                        old, those most severely stressed and those with compromised immune systems.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">“Positive ion poisoning”</h1>
                    <p>Along with all the benefits modern technology has provided, unfortunately the 20th century industrial environment has drastically upset ion levels and the “natural” electrical quality of the air. While very few human activities add
                        the beneficial small negative ions to the atmosphere, many practices increase the levels of positive ions. Positive ions are also produced by combustion, by electronic apparatus and by synthetic materials and fabrics – all of which
                        are extensively used in urban societies. And outdoor air quality, while important, is not the major issue. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that average people spend 80-90% of their lives indoors, where the air is
                        usually worse. Most indoor time is typically spent in relatively tightly sealed “energy efficient” buildings, where many pollutants – both gases and particulates – become concentrated and reach their highest levels. It’s also indoors
                        – including inside cars, trucks, airplanes, etc. – where, as Albert Krueger, MD (the late UC Berkeley researcher and founder of the Air Ion Research laboratory) argued, most individuals are exposed to either ion depletion or a
                        condition called “positive ion poisoning.” The problem is further compounded by central heating and cooling systems and by the effects of people crowded together and breathing in confined spaces.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Health & Performance Effects:</h1>
                    <p>Dr. Albert P. Krueger*, a microbiologist and experimental pathologist at the University of California, found that an astonishingly small quantity of negative ions could kill bacteria and quickly take them out of the air so that they
                        were less likely to infect people. This is particularly useful to patients recovering from burns in particular.</p>
                    <p>(Krueger, A. P. “The Action of Air Ions on Bacteria.” Journal of General Physiology. Berkeley: University of California, 1957.)</p>
                    <p>Research papers from St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, Australia’s National University (A.N.U), the Pavlov Institute in Russia, all showed that improved lung capacity and relief from asthma symptoms are achieved quite rapidly by
                        exposure to small negative air ions.</p>
                    <p>Affecting serotonin levels- (Serotonin is a brain chemical related to mood and stress. Anti-depressant drugs, e.g. Prozac, alter brain metabolism of serotonin). In 1985 a European research project exposed over 100 out patients at a
                        mental health clinic to negative ionization for just 40 minutes per day. After only a few sessions,50% of depressive patients reported a return to normal; 75% of headache patients had their pain disappear, 80% of insomnia patients
                        returned to normal sleep patterns, and 100% of anxiety sufferers said their symptoms had disappeared.</p>
                    <p>A study relating to the relativity of increased negative ions and increases in Immunoglobulin A (IgA) from Australia’s La Trobe University states. “such a finding is suggestive of an enhancement of the immune response as a result of
                        negative ionization . IgA guards against viral and bacterial attachment and colonization of mucous membrane.” In other words it helps stop lung infections.</p>
                    <p>In an interesting twist, Josh Beckon, a member of the Department of Cardiology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, writes in an Internet posting that in order to increase left-hemisphere activity (linear, language, logical), one can
                        block the left nostril and engage in “forced unilateral nostril breathing.” Likewise, to increase right-hemisphere activity (creative, holistic, emotional), the right nostril should be blocked. This practice increases the supply
                        of negative ions to a specific hemisphere.</p>

                        Lamps, by emitting negative ions, significantly reduce a myriad of indoor air pollutants. Negative ions have known benefits, and may provide relief from sinus, migraine headaches allergies and hay fever, reduce the severity of
                        asthma attacks, enhance the immune system, increase alertness, increase work productivity and concentration, increase lung capacity and reduce susceptibility to colds and flu.</p>
                    <p>Non-illuminated crystals (cool Salt Crystal, underground Salt Mines) produce Negative Ionizing effect, however the Salt Crystal Lamps which are illuminated from inside with a lamp (warm Salt Crystal) produces and emits a higher number
                        of Negative Ions and delivers a more efficient Ionizing Effect. Today, the health benefits of Negative Ions are well recognized all over the world. While most ionizers on the market are man-made machines, the Salt Crystal Lamps
                        are a beautiful, less costly, maintenance free, natural alternative of Mother Nature’s to improve air quality. With time, the Salt Crystal Lamps will not reduce in size, color or shape, and will not loose weight, or their ionizing

                    <p>Himalaya has the largest salt deposits in the world with 1290 running miles and can last another 365 years by improving our air quality and healing many diseases.</p>
                    <p>In Europe, bioenergeotherapists and homoeopathists recommend salt crystal lamps to assist in the treatment of many health conditions. Even though they are not a “medical device”, Salt Crystal Lamps, by emitting negative ions, significantly
                        reduce a myriad of indoor air pollutants. Negative ions have known benefits, and may provide relief from sinus, migraine headaches allergies and hay fever, reduce the severity of asthma attacks, enhance the immune system, increase
                        alertness, increase work productivity and concentration, increase lung capacity and reduce susceptibility to colds and flu. The salt crystal lamps have a similar effect to the ionizer. However, the natural ionization of a crystal
                        lamp cannot be compared to an ionizer. A salt crystal lamp can only have an ionization effect. However, salt crystal lamps have many advantages in many aspects and improve the general atmosphere of a room.</p>
                    <p>If the lamp is next to a television or computer monitor, its effect, through its electromagnetic field, of the device is in approximately the 100-160 Hz zone. Our brain waves however, produce only 8 Hz according to the Schuman resonance
                        frequency. Therefore, the body is exposed to up to 20 times higher frequency patterns than it is generally used to. The consequences of this exposure results in nervousness, insomnia and lack of concentration or concentration weaknesses.
                        In addition, there will be an accumulation of more free radicals in the body, known to be a cause of cancer.The salt crystal lamp binds the negative ions with the excessive positive ions. When the lamp becomes warm, it absorbs
                        moisture and the crystal will be damp on the surface. This builds up the ion field. Through the lamp, the positively charged atmosphere of a room can be neutralized.In addition to this, the colors of the salt crystal stones have
                        a healing effect. The therapeutic value of the colored crystals can reorganize the epidermal layer of our skin. Tests made with kids having ADHD symptoms have shown that after only one week of exposure to crystal salt lamps, their
                        symptoms subsided. After removing the lamps, the symptoms returned.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Research results:</h1>
                    <p>It’s a well known fact that, through scientific and empirical research, salt crystal lamps exhibit biophysical characteristics, which demonstrate a positive effect on our well-being. From a scientific view there are three natural action
                        principles at play: ionization, the electromagnetic oscillation and the transparent-crystalline structure developing the light waves.</p>
                    <p>Before we discuss the above mentioned characteristics of the salt crystal lamps in detail, we would like to point out that salt is a primal element, like water and air and its natural minerals and trace element have unique biophysical
                        and biochemical characteristics. Salt is to be regarded as neutral, chemically as well as physically, without its own polarity, always balancing and neutralizing. Exactly like our planet earth’s makeup, human beings consist of
                        about 70% water; brine water more specifically. This enormous potential on enclosed brine solution transmits the cosmic oscillation (vibration) energy, not only evenly over our planets, but also reaches deep into our most minute
                        cells and nerves. It is not only the salt from a chemical view that the body needs in order to maintain our entire bodily functions, but the salt, from biophysical view, will always be able to bring the body back into its natural
                        energy vibration rhythm.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Salt Crystal Lamps and Ionization:</h1>
                    <p>Worldwide laboratory tests with the most diverse kinds of measuring methodology furnished the proof that lighted salt crystal lamps deliver ions to our environment. Primarily, the research points to an increased number of negative
                        ions. The emission of ions is primarily caused by the alternating actions of the salt’s ability to first absorb water, and then evaporate it. To explain this more precisely, the heated salt crystal attracts the water molecules
                        from the ambient air to its surface.</p>
                    <p>The salt goes into a solution as it mixes with the water molecules. Sodium, as the positively charged ion, and chloride, as a negatively charged ion, becomes neutral and are emitted back into the environment. The uniqueness of this
                        ion emission interrelation is only possible with the mineral salt, since salt possesses this transformation ability with water due to its electrically neutral atomic structure. Scientific investigations of the last decades proved
                        clearly that a balanced ion relationship with a little surplus of negative ions could have extremely positive affects on our entire physical condition and our health. The heated salt crystal lamps can be referred to, according
                        to research, as natural ion generators. Here however it is pointed out that the emission of ions by heated salt crystal lamps, should not be regarded as the primary characteristic, because from scientific standpoint, the surplus
                        of negative ions is negligible. More important is its ability to clean the ambient air.</p>
                    <p>Depending upon size and surface area of the salt crystal used for the lamp, the ambient air surrounding it is measurably cleaned by the transformation cycle of hydrogen and oxygen, as well as sodium and chloride ions. This characteristic
                        is especially helpful for relieving the symptoms associated with asthma and allergies in general. The research of the characteristics of pure, or cleaned air through the action of the salt crystal lamps, is based on a medical therapy
                        called Spelaeotherapy, a treatment where the patient enters an underground salt mine and is exposed to the concentrated atmosphere of negative ions. Further scientific research has not taken place yet under medical guidance, since
                        scientific investigations are still at the beginning stages.</p>
                    <p>One cannot compare the therapeutic effect of a singular salt crystal lamp to the effects found in a salt cave (mine), when conducted according to medical guidelines. However, there have been a great variety of holistic and positive
                        self-therapy results, which can be classified as scientifically subjective, and should be recognized and considered.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Salt Crystal Lamps and Light Waves:</h1>
                    <p>When we talk about light we mean, for the most part, the oscillation energies, or electromagnetic wavelengths, which lie in a nanometer, range visible to our human eye. From the colour therapy it is well-known that the human organism
                        needs the light waves of the rainbow spectrum (300-700 nanometers) for the health and preservation of the body. Our body’s cells are supplied by light with new energy in the form of electromagnetic wavelengths. Thus the atomic
                        structure of each individual cell vibrates in its own given order and can radiate bio photons as the cell’s own electromagnetic energy field.</p>
                    <p>The specific oscillation values of salt crystal lamps depend upon crystalline colour structure in the so-called warm clay/tone range of 600-700 nanometers. For decades, the field of medicine has been using irradiation with monochromatic
                        light, since these colour vibration areas exert direct influence on our cell producing functions. To what extent a salt crystal lamp can be employed for natural irradiation therapy, is yet to be seen without further research. However,
                        salt crystal lamps have been used therapeutically for years.</p>

                    <p>Salt crystal lamp is simply known as salt lamp also! It is made from salt crystal rocks formed by nature over hundreds of millions of years ago. When mining the salt crystals, explosives are strictly prohibited to preserve the structures
                        of the crystals. Lamps are carefully crafted by hand to retain the unique, beautiful and natural shape of the rock. The result is a rare crystal with such beautiful colors ranging from off-white to apricot and warm pink. As the
                        light bulb or a tea light warms up the lamp, healthful NEGATIVE IONS lift off from the surface and help to cleanse and improve the quality and freshness of the air you breathe.</p>

                    <p>Our well being and our efficiency are considerably dependent on the quality of the air we breath. Air consists of many electrically charged particles — positively, negatively charged or neutral particles. The quality of the air we
                        breathe depends on the kind of electrical charge and concentration of the ions.</p>
                    <p>Salt crystal lamps are known to improve the quality of the air by producing negative ions — the “vitamins of the air”, by emitting a huge number of ions when being illuminated from inside (warm) which is essential for our health and
                        well being which is severely affected these days by our hi-tech life style.</p>
                    <p>The environment we live in today has far more sources of positive ions than in the past, creating an electrical imbalance in the air. Various human activities and electrical appliances produce positive ions which are the reasons for
                        the deterioration of our physical and emotional well being; e.g. discharge of voltage in high-voltage networks, heating and cooling systems, TVs, radios, transmitters, radar systems, computers, exhausts and cigarette fumes.</p>
